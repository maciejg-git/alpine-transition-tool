This simple tool started as a makeshift page to debug some transition problems in another app. It proved useful in solving that and in gaining a better understanding of Alpine (and Vue) transitions, so I added a few UI elements and turned it into this very simple app.

To use it, simply fill in the transition classes, hit toggle and check the logs to see details of each transition frame, including reactive effects, transition classes, TransitionEvents, and more.
